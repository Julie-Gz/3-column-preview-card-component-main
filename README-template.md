## My process

I started with a mobile first approach because I thought it would be easier to focus on the design of each card and then just use flexbox later to have them sit side by side in larger screens. Each card had its display set to grid with 8 columns and 6 rows. The number of rows was changed from 6 to 10 in larger screens to place the contents more comfortably on the page, with 6 rows everthing looked cramped and some of the content (the title and icons) overlapped.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

In this challenge I primarily used CSS-grid for the layout. CSS-grid allows you to place your content in the page the way you want it regardless of the size of the page.


### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid) : The mdn docs explains how css grid works and how using different units affect the layout.
